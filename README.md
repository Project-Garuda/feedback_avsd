## PURPOSE 
  The purpose of developing this “Faculty Feedback Management System” is to make the process of Faculty
Feedback simple and easier by avoiding manual feedback system.

## SCOPE
  It will integrate the benefits of a feedback with the convenience of a ‘no manual’ feedback collection. This will
provide more flexibility in getting the feedback without any manual distribution of feedback forms among the
students. The system is more secure and reliable in terms of feedback cause the system ensures that a student cannot
fill a form more than once and only registered students can fill the form.

## Proposed System
  The new feedback management system makes the process easier. The proposed system has three interfaces
one for faculty, one for admin and one for students. Admin needs to enter the details of courses taken by each
student, the section he/she is enrolled in and the details of the course instructors. Student needs to open the portal
and select course from the list of courses available and submit the feedback. Faculty can login and view the
responses submitted for their respective courses. 

#### The system has been presented with the following interfaces :)
